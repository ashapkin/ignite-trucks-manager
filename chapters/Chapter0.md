### Introduction

There are many different definitions of what's Apache Ignite and what type of application could benefit from it. I'd say that Apache Ignite is a distributed database and almost any application could utilize it in a proper way. In this walk-through guide, we are going to explore its features by building a modern .NET application - the RESTful Transportation Service. We will start from scratch and explorer step-by-step the key features of Apache Ignite focusing on practical experience.

### The application

The transportation service could be considered as an analog of Uber or another taxi/transportation services. There are multiple users and drivers, a user could schedule a route, a driver should pick a user from some starting point and deliver him to the destination. We will start with some auxiliary chapter about how to install Apache Ignite, scaffold a .NET RESTful service, and so on and then come back with more business-related tasks like querying data storage, money processing, performing analytical computations, and so on in order to explorer Apache Ignite capabilities. As a result, there should be a solid working and ready to ship business application.


### Summary

For now, you should have some feelings about what we are going to do, therefore let's get started with Apache Ignite installation.
