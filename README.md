# ignite-trucks-manager

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Apache Ignite API.

### Structure

The repository consists of multiple chapters that describe a particular problem and its solution. Once it gets completed, it could be considered as a walk-through guide or practical experience from the .NET perspective.

To switch to another chapter, just check out to it:
```sh
git checkout chapter-4
```

There should be a Chapter4.md readme file with a short description of a chapter and code changes.
